Recommendations for Integrated Media Preview:
1.	Clear Visual Confirmation:
o	Single File: 
	Image: Display a clear, reasonably large thumbnail of the image directly within the upload box, replacing the initial "drag & drop" prompt.
	Video: Display a video player preview (like the one in image_acad75.png but inside the upload box), showing the first frame or a standard poster, with standard play/pause controls.
o	Multiple Files: 
	Arrange previews (image thumbnails and/or video placeholders/thumbnails) in a grid layout within the box.
	Keep thumbnails large enough to be recognizable but small enough to fit multiple items.
	If the number of files exceeds the visible area, the grid container must become vertically scrollable.
2.	Easy Removal:
o	Each preview item (image thumbnail or video player/thumbnail) must have a clear and easily clickable 'x' icon, typically placed in the top-right corner.
o	Clicking the 'x' should instantly remove that specific file from the selection and update the preview display.
3.	Clean Presentation:
o	Padding: Ensure adequate padding around the preview(s) within the upload box border so they don't feel cramped. Also, ensure consistent spacing between items in the grid view (if multiple files).
o	Background: Consider if the background of the upload box behind the previews should remain white or take on a very subtle tint (light grey or a pale theme color) to visually group the selected items. A subtle tint often works well.
o	Consistency: Maintain visual style (e.g., corner rounding) consistent with the overall UI design.
4.	Informative Hover State (Optional Enhancement):
o	On hovering over a preview thumbnail, consider displaying the filename and/or file size as a tooltip for users who need that detail without cluttering the main view.
5.	Graceful Fallback:
o	If a file type is unsupported or a preview cannot be generated, display a generic file-type icon along with the filename instead of a broken image or player.
By implementing these points, the integrated preview within the upload box will provide clear feedback, easy management, and a clean, user-friendly experience.
